### Dependent Variable
- Dependent variables are measured or tested and depend on independent variables.
### Independent Variable
- Independent variables are manipulated and believed to have an effect on the dependent variable.
### Statistical Significant Effect
- Statistical significant variables are unlikely to have occurred by chance, likely to be real (not due to a random chance).
## Linear Regression
![linear regression.webp](/img/user/Machine%20Learning/Lecture%202/linear%20regression.webp)
- Statistical model that helps model the impact of a unit change in a variable(independent) on the values of another target variable (dependent), when their relationship is linear in nature.
- TYPES:
	- 1 Independent Variable $\rightarrow$ Simple Linear Regression.
	- 2 or more Independent Variables $\rightarrow$ Multiple Linear Regression.

### Simple Linear Regression

- The formula for simple linear regression is: $y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x + \epsilon$ ,Where:
	- $y$ is the dependent variable (the outcome you are trying to predict).
	- $x$ is the independent variable (the predictor).
	- $\beta_0$ is the y-intercept of the regression line.
	- $\beta_1$ is the slope of the regression line.
	- $\epsilon$ is the error term (the difference between the observed and predicted values).
### Multiple Regression Formula

- The formula for multiple regression is: $y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1 + \beta_2 x_2 + \cdots + \beta_p x_p + \epsilon$ Where:
	- $y$ is the dependent variable (the outcome you are trying to predict).
	- $x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_p$ are the independent variables (the predictors).
	- $\beta_0$ is the y-intercept of the regression plane (or hyperplane).
	- $\beta_1, \beta_2, \ldots, \beta_p$ are the coefficients (slopes) for each predictor.
	- $\epsilon$ is the error term (the difference between the observed and predicted values).
