#### **Supervised Learning:**

1. In supervised learning, the model is trained on labeled data which means the input data is paired with the correct output.
2. The model learns from this labeled training data to make predictions or decisions on unseen data.
3. This type of learning is commonly used for classification and regression problems.
4. Key Algorithms: include regression algorithms for continuous data prediction and classification algorithms for categorical data labeling.
5. Evaluation: The performance of supervised models is assessed using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

#### **Unsupervised Learning:**

1. Unsupervised learning involves training models on data that is not labeled, and the model tries to learn the patterns and structures directly from the input data.
2. Clustering is a common unsupervised learning application where the model groups similar data points together.
3. This type of learning is useful for dimensionality reduction, anomaly detection, and data organization.
4. Key Algorithms: include clustering methods like K-means and DBSCAN, and dimensionality reduction methods like PCA.
5. Evaluation: The quality and utility of unsupervised learning models can be measured using metrics like silhouette score, completeness, and homogeneity.

#### **Differentiation between Supervised and Unsupervised Learning:**

1. **Training Data**: Supervised learning uses labeled training data where the correct answer is provided. Unsupervised learning uses unlabeled data, where the model works to explore the patterns in the data without explicit guidance.
2. **Predictions**: In supervised learning, the model predicts an output based on input and labeled examples. In unsupervised learning, the model attempts to uncover inherent structures within the data without a specific output target.
3. **Tasks**: Supervised learning is commonly used for classification tasks and regression problems. Unsupervised learning is often applied to clustering, anomaly detection, and dimensionality reduction tasks.
4. **Objective**: The purpose of supervised learning is to approximate a mapping function so well that it can make accurate predictions on unseen data. Unsupervised learning aims to capture the hidden patterns or underlying structure in the data.
