##### **Data Preparation**:

 The initial step is to prepare the data for training the machine learning model. This involves organizing the data, handling missing values, and ensuring that the data is in a suitable format for training.
    
##### **Model Training**:

Once the data is prepared, the model needs to be trained using the prepared data. During this phase, the model learns to identify patterns and relationships within the data to make predictions or classifications.
    
##### **Hyperparameter Tuning**:

After training the initial models, the next step is to fine-tune the model parameters through a process called hyperparameter tuning. This involves optimizing the model's hyperparameters to improve its performance.
    
##### **Prediction**:

Once the model is trained and the hyperparameters are optimized, the model is used to make predictions on new, unseen data.
    
##### **Test Error Rate**:

The final step involves evaluating the model's performance using the test error rate. This metric helps to assess how well the model generalizes to new, unseen data and provides insights into the model's accuracy and effectiveness.
